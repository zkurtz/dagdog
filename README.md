Lightweight DAGs for data analysis dev ops. By the time you finish a data analysis with this lil puppy, you'll never want to use a Jupyter notebook again because
- your code will already be modular, extendable, reuseable etc, ready to move towards production
- you will have spend far less time waiting for your notebook to rerun, focusing on modular components instead of rerunning to the whole thing each time.
